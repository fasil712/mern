# Backend Project

Welcome to the backend project! This repository contains the backend codebase for our application.

## Overview

The backend project is responsible for handling data storage, business logic, and communication with the client-side applications. It serves as the core engine that powers our application's functionality.

## Features

- **API Endpoints:** Implement RESTful APIs to handle client requests and responses.
- **Database Management:** Interact with the database to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure endpoints and manage user access using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Middleware Integration:** Utilize middleware for request processing, logging, error handling, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the process of building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing and managing structured data.

## Getting Started

To set up the backend project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Set up environment variables for database connection strings, authentication tokens, etc.
5. Run the application using `npm start`.
6. Access the API endpoints via your preferred API client (e.g., Postman).
